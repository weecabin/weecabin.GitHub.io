Practice vectoring any number of aircraft to a multiple runway airport.<br>
After opening, click Start to run the simulator.<br>
Add planes one at a time or continuously by respectively clicking "Add Plane" or "Add Planes".<br>
"Add Planes" allows you to specify where planes will be added on the screen, and the delay between additions.<br>
Specify an aircraft altitude or speed by clicking next to the aircraft to select it, then click either "Altitude" or "Speed" from the menu. Selected aircraft are painted green.<br>
Planes with separation warnings are painted yellow, and alarms red.<br>
If a selected plane has a separation issue, it will blink green then the warning or alarm color.<br>
Use drag vector just like IF. The vector is sent when you lift your finger. When you put your finger down, the closest aircraft becomes the object of the drag vector.<br>
Use two fingers to pan, and pinch to zoom in or out.
